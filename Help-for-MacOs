Hello, here I give you some commands which were. useful for the installation on mac

**** On mac try to execute the installation command with replacing postgres with _postgres before entering on the postgresql server. ****

Check that you've enabled the postgresql and redis servers, with those commands $ brew services run postgresql, $ brew services run redis.

If this command $ sudo -u postgres createuser -P peertube gave you an error you can try this $ sudo -u _postgres createuser -U peertube it's work for me. ( if the second command doesn't work for you, try to open postgresql and do that if you only want an simple user $ CREATE ROLE your_username or this if you want add some rights $ CREATE ROLE your_username SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE;

SUPERUSER: allow you to be super user.
CREATEDB : allow you to create database.
CREATEROLE: allow you to create new role.

Use them according to your needs.

If you already create your user and you want to allow it to create a database, do that $ ALTER USER your_username CREATEDB;

After that if this command doesn't work $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O peertube peertube_dev for you, restart the postgresql server and do $ CREATE DATABASE peertube_dev; and do that if you need $ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE peertube_dev to peertube;this command allow your user named peertube to have all rights to this database

Once the user and database are created you can follow the rest of the peertube installation step, hopefully that will help some of you.
