    # Introduction
    The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S). Our API is RESTful. It has predictable
    resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also
    accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. No official
    SDK is currently provided.

    # Authentication
    When you sign up for an account, you are given the possibility to generate
    sessions, and authenticate using this session token. One session token can 
    currently be used at a time.

  - name: Accounts
    description: >
      Using some features of PeerTube require authentication, for which Accounts

      provide different levels of permission as well as associated user
      information.

      Accounts also encompass remote accounts discovered across the federation.
  - name: Config
    description: >
      Each server exposes public information regarding supported videos and
      options.
  - name: Feeds
    description: |
      Feeds of videos and feeds of comments allow to see updates and get them in
      an aggregator or script of your choice.
  - name: Job
    description: >
      Jobs are long-running tasks enqueued and processed by the instance
      itself. 

      No additional worker registration is currently available.
  - name: ServerFollowing
    description: >
      Managing servers which the instance interacts with is crucial to the
      concept

      of federation in PeerTube and external video indexation. The PeerTube
      server

      then deals with inter-server ActivityPub operations and propagates 

      information across its social graph by posting activities to actors' inbox

      endpoints.
  - name: VideoAbuse
    description: |
      Video abuses deal with reports of local or remote videos alike.
  - name: Video
    description: |
      Operations dealing with listing, uploading, fetching or modifying videos.
  - name: Search
    description: |
      The search helps to find _videos_ from within the instance and beyond.
      Videos from other instances federated by the instance (that is, instances
      followed by the instance) can be found via keywords and other criteria of
      the advanced search.
  - name: VideoComment
    description: >
      Operations dealing with comments to a video. Comments are organized in
      threads.
  - name: VideoChannel
    description: >
      Operations dealing with creation, modification and video listing of a
      user's

      channels.
