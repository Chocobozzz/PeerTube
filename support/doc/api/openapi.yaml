    # Introduction

    The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite
    HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube. The spec API is fully compatible with
    [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/wiki/API-client-generator-HOWTO)
    which generates a client SDK in the language of your choice - we generate some client SDKs automatically:

    - [Python](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/python)
    - [Go](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/go)
    - [Kotlin](https://framagit.org/framasoft/peertube/clients/kotlin)

    See the [Quick Start guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/api-rest-getting-started) so you can play with the PeerTube API.

    # Authentication

    When you sign up for an account, you are given the possibility to generate
    sessions, and authenticate using this session token. One session token can
    currently be used at a time.

    ## Roles

    Accounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on
    PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/admin-managing-users?id=roles) for a detail of their permissions.

    # Errors

    The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure
    of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following
    format.

    ```
    {
      "code": "unauthorized_request", // example inner error code
      "error": "Token is invalid." // example exposed error message
    }
    ```

  - name: Accounts
    description: >
      Accounts encompass remote accounts discovered across the federation,
      and correspond to the main Actor, along with video channels a user can create, which
      are also Actors.

      When a comment is posted, it is done with your Account's Actor.
  - name: Users
    description: >
      Using some features of PeerTube require authentication, for which User
      provide different levels of permission as well as associated user
      information. Each user has a corresponding local Account for federation.
  - name: My User
    description: >
      Operations related to your own User, when logged-in.
  - name: My Subscriptions
    description: >
      Operations related to your subscriptions to video channels, their
      new videos, and how to keep up to date with their latest publications!
  - name: My Notifications
    description: >
      Notifications following new videos, follows or reports. They allow you
      to keep track of the interactions and overall important information that
      concerns you. You MAY set per-notification type delivery preference, to
      receive the info either by mail, by in-browser notification or both.
  - name: Config
    description: >
      Each server exposes public information regarding supported videos and
      options.
  - name: Job
    description: >
      Jobs are long-running tasks enqueued and processed by the instance
      itself. No additional worker registration is currently available.
  - name: Instance Follows
    description: >
      Managing servers which the instance interacts with is crucial to the
      concept of federation in PeerTube and external video indexation. The PeerTube
      server then deals with inter-server ActivityPub operations and propagates
      information across its social graph by posting activities to actors' inbox
      endpoints.

  - name: Instance Redundancy
    description: >
      Redundancy is part of the inter-server solidarity that PeerTube fosters.
      Manage the list of instances you wish to help by seeding their videos according
      to the policy of video selection of your choice. Note that you have a similar functionality
      to mirror individual videos, see `Video Mirroring`.

      Abuses deal with reports of local or remote videos/comments/accounts alike.
  - name: Video
    description: |
      Operations dealing with listing, uploading, fetching or modifying videos.
  - name: Search
    description: |
      The search helps to find _videos_ or _channels_ from within the instance and beyond.
      Videos from other instances federated by the instance (that is, instances
      followed by the instance) can be found via keywords and other criteria of
      the advanced search.

      Administrators can also enable the use of a remote search system, indexing
      videos and channels not could be not federated by the instance.
  - name: Video Comments
    description: >
      Operations dealing with comments to a video. Comments are organized in
      threads.
  - name: Video Playlists
    description: >
      Operations dealing with playlists of videos. Playlists are bound to users
      and/or channels.
  - name: Video Channels

      Operations dealing with the creation, modification and listing of videos within a channel.

        **Warning**: If you choose to make an index search, PeerTube will get results from a third party service.
        It means the instance may not yet know the objects you fetched. If you want to load video/channel information:
          * If the current user has the ability to make a remote URI search (this information is available in the config endpoint),
          then reuse the search API to make a search using the object URI so PeerTube instance fetches the remote object and fill its database.
          After that, you can use the classic REST API endpoints to fetch the complete object or interact with it
          * If the current user doesn't have the ability to make a remote URI search, then redirect the user on the origin instance or fetch
          the data from the origin instance API
