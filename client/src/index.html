      <p>You are blocking Javascript, and we totally get that. However this endpoint uses Angular, so the front end is in full JavaScript and won't work without it.
      </br></br>
      There will be other non JS-based clients to access PeerTube, but for now none is available as this is still alpha software. Be sure we will update this page with a list once alternative clients are developed. You can certainly develop you own in the meantime as our code is open source and libre software under GNU AGPLv3.0.
      </br></br>
      There might be numerous reasons you refuse to use JavaScript. If it has just to do with security (or lack thereof) of JavaScript-based webapps, then depending on your threat menace you might want to go through the code running on the node you are trying to access, and look for security audits.
