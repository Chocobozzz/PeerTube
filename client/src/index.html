      <p>It seems you are either <strong>blocking or disabling Javascript</strong> on your browser, and we totally get that. However this endpoint uses Angular, so the front end is in full JavaScript and won't work without it.</p>

      <p>There might be numerous reasons you refuse to use JavaScript. If it just has to do with security (or lack thereof) of JavaScript-based web applications, then depending on your threat menace you might want to go through the code running on the node you are trying to access, and look for security audits.</p>

      <p>There will be other non JS-based clients to access PeerTube, but for now none is available. Be sure we will update this page with a list once alternative clients are developed. You can certainly develop your own in the meantime as our code is open source and libre software under the <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU AGPLv3.0</a> and documented on <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html">docs.joinpeertube.org</a>.</p>
