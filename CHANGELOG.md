## v1.0.0-beta.10.pre.1

This version is a pre release because it contains many important changes, and requires manual steps before upgrading.

**Important:** Before upgrading run the following commands (no need to stop PeerTube) on your PeerTube database (in this example it's *peertube_prod*):

```
$ sudo -u postgres psql peertube_prod -c 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;'
$ sudo -u postgres psql peertube_prod -c 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;'
```

You will need [PostgreSQL Contrib](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/contrib.html).
