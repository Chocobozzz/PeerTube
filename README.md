## Demonstration

Want to see it in action?

   * Demonstration servers:
     * [peertube.cpy.re](http://peertube.cpy.re)
     * [peertube2.cpy.re](http://peertube2.cpy.re)
     * [peertube3.cpy.re](http://peertube3.cpy.re)
   * [Video](https://peertube.cpy.re/videos/watch/f78a97f8-a142-4ce1-a5bd-154bf9386504)
     to see what the "decentralization feature" looks like

*Currently PeerTube is still in alpha (we plan to release a beta in march). Demonstration servers do not support public registration. If you really want to test PeerTube before the public release, here is a list of PeerTube servers: https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/wiki#other-peertube-servers.*

## Why

We can't build a FOSS video streaming alternatives to YouTube, Dailymotion,
Vimeo... with a centralized software. One organization alone may not have
enough money to pay for bandwidth and video storage of its servers.

So we need to have a decentralized network of servers seeding videos (as
[Diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora) for example).  But it's not
enough because one video could become famous and overload the server.  It's the
reason why we need to use a P2P protocol to limit the server load.  Thanks to
[WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent), we can make P2P (thus
BitTorrent) inside the web browser, as of today.

## Run using Docker

You can quickly get a server running using Docker. You need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

For this example configuration, you should also run a reverse proxy. The example
Docker Compose file provides example labels for the Traefik load balancer,
though any HTTP reverse proxy is compatible.

Example for running a peertube server locally:

```bash
sudo \
  PEERTUBE_HOSTNAME=peertube.lvh.me \
  PEERTUBE_ADMIN_EMAIL=test@example.com \
  PEERTUBE_TRANSCODING_ENABLED=true \
  docker-compose up app
```

(Get the initial root user password from the program output.)

## API REST documentation

For now only on Github:

 * HTML version: [/support/doc/api/html/index.html](/support/doc/api/html/index.html)
 * Swagger/OpenAPI schema: [/support/doc/api/openapi.yaml](/support/doc/api/openapi.yaml)

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a more detailed explanation.

### Backend

  * The backend is a REST API.
  * Servers communicate with each others with [Activity
    Pub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).
  * Each server has its own users who query it (search videos, query where the
    torrent URI of this specific video is...).
  * If a user uploads a video, the server seeds it and sends its followers some
    metadata (name, short description, torrent URI...).
  * A server is a tracker responsible for all the videos uploaded in it.
  * Even if nobody watches a video, it is seeded by the server (through
    [WebSeed protocol](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html)) where the
    video was uploaded.

Here are some simple schemes:
